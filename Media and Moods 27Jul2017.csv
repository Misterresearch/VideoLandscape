Setbacks: I felt we were making a lot of progress throughout the last eight years. The new administration came in, as any does, and started wiping away as much as they could. I'm worried about my rights as a woman, in particular for healthcare that doesn't consider any of my pre-existing conditions, as well as birth control coverage, access to services like Planned Parenthood, etc. I'm worried about trans people having the ability to use a bathroom that corresponds with who they identify as. I'm worried about not helping people around the world who are in need - Syrian refugees in particular. The government continues to try to limit the rights of people of color, particularly in voting.Frustration: I can't believe that we elected someone so poorly qualified to hold the most important job in our country. I'm embarrassed, and I find it hard to engage with family members who I know voted for the President without getting upset or angry. I'm particularly frustrated that he has been able to name so many unqualified people to positions of power.Anxiety: All the things I identified earlier as worries give me anxiety. Perhaps what most bothers me is that the President already was able to name one Supreme Court Justice, whom I disagree with on nearly every issue, and may get to name one or two more which will have a lasting impact for generations to come. I worry that the world may struggle to exists for my children and their children if we continue to disregard things like global warming, fracking, oil, etc.Hopeful: I remain hopeful that this administration will be out in no more than four years and that we will see a shift in power back to the left - not only at the federal level but at the state level as well.

Not so great - The rich are getting richer. In general, we still tend to treat those who are different from us terribly. We don't want to help those who need it most. Women and people of color are still treated as second class citizens; we want to limit the rights of people of color to ensure the white man continues to prosper. God forbid someone identify as something that doesn't seem ""natural"" or ""as God intended."" Our leaders put religion ahead of science, evidence, and reason. We still can't get any legislation passed, despite the Republicans being in complete power. Police continue to kill unarmed citizens daily, without having to take responsibility for their actions. Students are taking on incredible amounts of debt to pay for a college degree and then struggle to find jobs that pay well enough to start repaying said loans.","The wrong direction - we continue to destroy the environment, limit women's and GLBTQ rights, continue to see police brutality against our own citizens (and now even citizens of other countries), have seen an increase in hate crimes, and we have people in leadership positions who either don't think these things are wrong, or are too afraid of their own political party to do so."Eugene L.,San Francisco,Male,18-34,Blue,$75K or more,Cauc,News non-viewer,Hillary Clinton,"Divided - This last presidential election helped point out how different people are in AmericaæTrump - The reason for the divide.

Free health care should be one of the nations top concerns but it's not. Millennial's - As someone from this generation, I can easily say that most of us are lazy with a sense of entitlement.

It is easy to start a company, make money and work for yourself in 2017. This survey is a great example of that. With half an hour of research and a few hours of work anyone can make money. People are able to be connected more than ever were before. At the same time, a lot of the aspects (technology) that are making our country so great, are also hurting us. I find technology makes me more and more anxious. I am missing out on something? I constantly need to be doing five different things. It can be hard sometimes to handle. In terms of politics, the think I dislike so much about Trump is how much he dominates our lives and minds. I have talked more about Trump since he was elected president than I ever did about Obama. Obama who? Its all Trump all the time. And it is exhausting.","This is a really tough question. On the one hand, I think a lot of aspects of American life are moving in the correct direction. Access to information is incredibly easy. Our access to technology is extensive. Anyone can be famous, anyone can make money, anyone can rapidly increase their intelligence. More and more information is crowd sourced and open for everyone else to use. Little things like food and coffee are made so that the best can rise because of technology. Because we vote and rank and explain our experiences everywhere you can be sure that you are getting some of the best you can. This is amazing. This also causes anxiety though. And the lack of connections. Through technology, we interact in person. Live is now checking phone, being on a computer all day etc. It changes.In terms of politics, we are going in the wrong direction. Our government is the most incompetent it has been in a long time. No smart young people want to go into politics, and even if they do it is so slow moving and frozen that it takes twenty years to get anywhere, and making an impact is impossible.

Wether these are things that I agree with or disagree with, they show that they feel that if it does not go their way it is the end of the world when it is clearly not.Not comprehending - If you were to pull up a news story from whatever source you could probably find at least one story on there that you can sit back and ask yourself if you have the whole picture.

I like the example of Steve Jobs. Many people like to state the fact that he became extremely successfull after dropping out of college, which he did. But they skip the fact that he dropped out of college, technically, but he continued to go to classes and learn new things while also deepening his understanding outside of the classroom.

It's all really quite irritating. I consider myself a Libertarian and am all for reducing the government's interference in our lives as much as possible. So, when turning on the news (or even just reading the news) it is nearly impossible to not see/read an article about the current administrations doings (or misdoings). Maybe it's always been this way and I am only now noticing it because I am getting older (30) and paying more attention to what's going on around me. Or maybe it's just the... Connectedness - the fact that we are so enthralled with technology means we don't really miss a whole lot. This has it's obvious pros and cons. (moving society forward and accomplishing things even recent generations never dreamed possible vs facilitating self-absorbed individuals' constant need for the dopamine rush of getting a new ""like""). Don't mistake connectedness for unity. While the internet has certainly been used to unify and create groups of like minded groups who are doing amazing things for humanity all around the world, being constantly connected to the internet has not necessarily helped us to harmonize as species. It has made it easier to (just imagine the impace if our president ONLY posted positive messages to other world leaders to his Twitter as opposed to mostly negative ones), but I can't possibly believe that we are more united in the world because of the connectedness that social media has brought us. Minimalism - I don't mean this in the sense that we are doing a great job of accomplishing more on fewer resources (although millennials seems to be doing this much better than other generations), but rather that we tend to have this mindset of ""what is the least I can do and still get by"". What is the least amount of work I can do and not get fired? What is the least amount of attention I can give my family and not destroy our relationships? What is the least amount of good I can do so that people can view me as a generally good person? Individualism - Again, this is similar to the above about not being united. We, as a society, are much more interested in ""What's in it for me?"" than we are ""How can I impact the most people?"" We protest this and that because we offended by what people think of us. We do what we want because that's freedom, right? Wrong. Freedom not the ability to do what we want when we want. It is having the choice to choose between right and wrong. Experiences - Again, maybe it's due to my age, or maybe it is a shift in thinking in our society. But I believe more and more people are starting to realize that things don't happiness; experiences do. So, more and more people are traveling and experiencing the world rather than focusing on accumulating things.","What's great - I see reform happening all over the place.

Gas is at a fair price (2.09 here in Nashville, though I think upto $3/gallon is fair when you compare our prices with pretty much anywhere else in the world.

How can we be the world's foremost superpower while ranking outside of the Top 5 (USnews.com)? Our healthcare system is a joke. I'm not necessarily speaking to the ACA or the current administration's proposed legislature. I'm talking about the absolutely ludicrous prices for procedures to be performed.

When I see a bill for a life-saving procedure from a myocardial infarction, my jaw drops...every time. Of course, insurance foots the bill mostly, but the up front cost is what needs to be changed. We spend too much money on diseasecare and not enough on prevention.","Honestly, I don't know. I am torn about our ""relationship"" with Russia. We are basically going through a second Cold War with them. Initially, while I thought all the Trump and Putin memes were funny, I was all for improving our relationship with Russia (God knows I don't want to go to war with them). However, with the president's potential pre-election ties with Russia further complicating the mess, it's hard to say if we are going in the right or wrong direction. If they helped him win the seat and we don't do anything about it, what kind of message are we sending? Additionally, I'm ready for peace. We have been in the Middle East for 16 years! It seems as though just as we are downsizing there, we are readying our forces for something else to happen somewhere else. Seriously, 9/11 happened when I was a Freshman in high school. It's hard for me to remember a time when we weren't at war.But, just like I said in the previous questions..the economy is great. We have flipping self driving cars on the roads and can schedule appointments and order pizza with a virtual personal assistant. I mean, we might as well call it a robot!

Not everyone is evil in America. There are still many good, giving people out there. They will help you without thinking twice about it. Whether it's stopping to help fix a flat, giving money to the homeless or helping an older person with groceries. It's the giving people that help remind us to help others when we can. Failing. Our school systems and parents are failing to prepare the youth for adult life. It takes parents and the schools working together to prepare the youth and they aren't always working together. If a parent is failing at home, it can be hard for the school to pick up the slack. And vice versa. We have youth graduating and barely able to read, write a paragraph or balance a checkbook. Drama.

If they want to serve the country, than let them be."Randy H.,Austin,Male,35-54,Red,$75K or more,Other Multi-Racial,News non-viewer,Donald Trump,"Divided, opportunity, entitled, spoiled, proud.æDivided because I think the people of America are pretty divided right now. For some reason people seem to be more intolerant of others feelings and beliefs. There seems to be a lot of stereo-typing when it comes to political and religious beliefs and people tend to be closed minded when it comes to understanding others points of view. Opportunity because there are a lot of opportunities in America. Opportunities to build the life you always wanted, get an education, meet someone, travel freely, start a business. The only thing holding most people back is their own personal drive. Entitled because people seem to feel an entitled to be taken care of. Health care, welfare, $15 per hour minimum wage, a cell phone, a house. People seem to think these things should be free or very cheap and they shouldn't have to work hard for them. Spoiled because we take so many things for granted. Clean water, electricity, food are all things that countries very close to us don't have but you would be hard pressed to find someone in America who doesn't have these things readily available to them. We have been very blessed to have all of these things and shouldn't take them for granted. Proud because we don't have to worry about the things in the paragraph above. Past American have worked hard to build what we have today. We have a strong military, rich economy, and good ethics.","The opportunities we have in America are great. If you want to go to school there is a way, if you want to build a business there is a way. If you want to drive across the country living in your car there is a way. We are free to worship whatever God we believe in. So many things we can do in this country that you can't in other countries. It's not so great that people keep trying to bring up differences and make a big deal about them. Our younger generations are still having to answer for things their grandparents and great great great grandparents did. The political fighting is not great. It hasn't been for many years. We have a leader and everyone should be hoping and praying that he succeeds for the benefit of our country.",I wouldn't say we are headed in the right or wrong direction. I don't think we are headed in a direction at all. We seem to be just treading water at the moment. Some things are good and some are bad but I don't see any particular direction in which we are going.Romy D.,Los Angeles,Female,18-34,Blue,Less than $75K,Cauc,News non-viewer,Hillary Clinton,"PolarizedæControversial Activism Trump DeceivingMost of the words I chose have to do with the current political climate. Our country is in a state of constant political turmoil, resulting in a polarized society. Each issue is controversial and can either spark discussion or argument. Trump and his administration are the root of much of the controversy as well as the activism that has risen to counteract him. I chose deceiving because day-to-day life does not always reflect the overall state of unease that our country is in. Daily life can easily go about normally with regular ups and downs filling our days. There is a lot happening, but sometimes it can go unacknowledged.","I maintain that America has one of the highest standards of living in the world. We have amazing technology, innovation, and immense freedom to express ourselves and our opinions. It is not so great that the government is challenging transgender rights or women's right to choose or other such issues, but it is amazing that we have the freedom to speak openly about our opposition and to take action in whichever direction we feel we ought to. There are good things and bad things about the current administration, as there always are, but America is nevertheless a remarkable country.","I'm not sure I'm educated enough on most current issues to really make a relevant statement about the direction of our country. As I've stated, I disagree with much of the action the current administration is taking but approve of many grassroots movements. As far as social issues go, I think we are moving in the wrong direction, as far as I can tell. Discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation is something we should be moving away from as quickly as possible, but that does not seem to be the case. Still, I do not think we are on a road to ruin or anything apocalyptic like that."Samantha N.,San Diego,Female,18-34,Blue,Less than $75K,Hisp,News non-viewer,Did not vote,"Fast - It seems like there's never any time to just sit back and enjoy the company of your friends.æMessy - I can't keep up with what's going on. There's always some issue going on that leads to more issues, and none of them ever seem to get resolved. Sensitive - You used to be able to express your opinion openly without getting looked down upon. Although now things seem to be more liberal, it seems that you can't have a different opinion from the majority without getting attacked, and it's safer to be wishy washy than to actually have a stance. Distant - We all have means to communicate with people instantly. But I remember being a teenager without so much social media and I had more actual ""face"" time with people. Making plans now to hang out is such a struggle. Everyone is always busy, and so am I. I remember deleting instagram and running into people I hadn't seen in a while at a party. It was interesting how so many people asked, ""Where have you been?!"" All because I had deleted Instagram, when really, I wasn't socializing that much when I had it either. Evolving - It's kind of hard to predict what life will be like next year, or even after. My parents' roles were pretty set. They grew up, got married, had kids. I'm past the age where my parents had kids, and I'm not married or even in a relationship, and I definitely don't have kids. In the past within my culture, that would have been a bad sign. But now with life as it is, there's a lot of opportunities, and there's not really such a thing as ""traditional"" anymore. I like that.","I think it's great that there's a lot of options in terms of education, employment, and lifestyles. Personally, I like being able to come and go as I please, and having the freedom to change my mind about what I'd like my future to look like. It's also great that there's a huge mix of people. I work at a high school and part of my job is testing the level of English of kids coming from out of the country to place them in the right classes. I meet kids from all over. I like traveling, but the great thing about living here is that you don't have to travel to learn about other cultures. You can just talk to people almost anywhere and ask about their backgrounds and you're instantly transported. I think the fact that we are so reliant on technology isn't so great. I remember life without GPS, and even though it's great and in my opinion the Pros outweigh the Cons, I don't like the idea of relying on it so much, only because if you don't have it, it throws you off. Same thing with social media and such. I've deleted accounts in the past and have realized how much time I spend on them, and realize how bored I am without them. Another specific thing is the family unit. This is more of an international thing, but working at a school I've seen so many broken families, and kids that are so distant from their parents because they're so busy that they have trouble making time for them. I remember always being my mom's priority, and it's had a huge impact on me. I'm not saying this is a new issue, but it's just gotten worse. I've seen technology become a babysitter for a lot of kids, and I just think people are getting more and more distant from family. This is also an issue in social events. People are stuck to their phones looking at what everyone else is doing, when there they are, at a restaurant with friends, and could be enjoying the moment instead.","I would say it's going in the wrong direction. Overall, I feel like morals and values are going down the drain, and people are becoming pretty apathetic. There's a lot less respect going around, and people get offended by simple things and don't let them go. People on the road are angry all of the time. I used to be more relaxed while driving, but now I'm tailgated at least once every day (and I'm always going with the flow of traffic, I'm definitely not a slow driver), and I've never been flipped off so much in my life. Like I mentioned, I work at a high school, and I see it there as well. Instead of teaching kids discipline, most of the time we give them what they want in order to avoid any issues and just appease their wishes. I know a lot of what kids get away with here would not stand a chance in other school systems. I like how much extra help is available to the students, but I don't like the idea of so many second chances. I feel like that's becoming a common practice here, and it's not really preparing any of them for reality, where you don't get those second chances at all."Sandi S.,Austin,Female,35-54,Red,$75K or more,Cauc,Weekly news viewer,Donald Trump,,,Sarah W.,St. Louis,Female,35-54,Red,$75K or more,Cauc,Weekly news viewer,Donald Trump,"Progressive - with everyone's individuality, the country is moving towards a more open and accepting place.

I think that on some fronts we have to really get it together. I say this because of things like climate change, and all the metric tons of plastic we are manufacturing and dumping in the ocean, the nuclear threat in North Korea, the US pulling out of the global climate initiative, the fact the no one in the Department of Energy knows what the agency does, according to Vanity Fair anyway, and when you turn on the national news channels all you see is stories about white house staffers, affairs, tweets, congressional debates, and staffers resigning, and being hired...It seems like the wrong way in that their is a lot of ""stuff"" floating around that seems disguised as a way to keep us from tackling what is really going on."Sydeny B.,San Diego,Female,18-34,Blue,$75K or more,Hisp,News non-viewer,Donald Trump,"upsetting, difficult, stressful, pressure, pessimismæ                                                                    I chose upsetting because it's hard to see our country and the world basically falling apart over issues that never had to come up in the first place. The words difficult, stressful, and pressure all apply to being a part of my generation. We are the generation who is expected to go to college and get a job and live the expected good lifestyle of the dream American citizens. But, college is expensive. We are up to our head in debt, plus the majority of well-paying jobs require YEARS of experience that we don't have, and we can't afford to buy cars and pay rent. The amount of college grads that went to respected universities that work at McDonalds or Starbucks is staggering. Every person I know that went to college over the last five years still lives with their parents out of school and is still trying to save up some money so they can afford the necessities. It's absolutely ridiculous and there is so much pressure on us, which makes life difficult and stressful. Pessimism is just the mood I feel around me everywhere I go. It seems like everybody is pissed off at something in the world, and it radiates onto me and it seems like optimism is nowhere to be found.","Even though we have our struggles and it seems like Trump is going to ruin everything about life, we are still a very privileged first-world country. It is nice to know that we still have our amendment rights and our freedom while other countries don't have the same luxury. The not so great parts are all over. Debt, unemployment, prices for everything are skyrocketing, the disbelief in global warming, people are getting away with rape charges (I'm looking at you, Brock Turner), the poverty rates, housing developments in places where people cannot afford them, water issues, health care.

It's hard not to think about almost daily. Feminism - There's a real shift happening for feminism and it makes me so happy. There's still so much work to be done, and even though we have hurdles in a Trump era, I really feel like we're making strides. The best part is people are talking about it. Not just women. We have a real gender perception issue still, and while we may get to a point in the future with equal rights, it'll never be the same until perception is changed.

Every inch we gain towards equal rights for all races, another person is unnecessarily killed.I'm happy that we are all out there debating these issues, but I don't feel like we're making any forward progress. With all the fake news out there on both sides, it's hard to understand what we're all really talking about. I find it difficult to have real conversations and debates, because my friends are so polarizing on both sides of the issue and it seems like no one wants to listen to the other side. Plus their arguments are so far-fetched that it gets us nowhere. It's frustrating."William W.,Phoenix,Male,35-54,Red,$75K or more,Cauc,News non-viewer,Donald Trump,No different than any other.,"Economy is doing well. Interest rates are low. We still enjoy all the same freedoms that we always had, if not more.","I think we are heading in the same direction that we had under the last leadership. I know there is posturing as to changing some of the immigration laws, but I think things for the most part have stayed the same. When you compare our border laws to that of almost any other country, especially Europe, you will find that we are still a very open country."Willis C.,,,,,,,,,,,Will J.,Dallas,Male,18-34,Red,$75K or more,AA,News non-viewer,Did not vote,,,Yahaida T.,Chicago,Female,35-54,Blue,$75K or more,Hisp,Weekly news viewer,Hillary Clinton,"Uncertain, not united, disengaged, bully, caaous. In America how I feel we are heading to a horrible place. Instead of coming together we are falling apart. Other countries and there people looked up to us. This was a country that was united had principles. Now it's just caaous so many un neccassry changes to healthcare people rights etc it's scary",Well rights great is that we still have our freedom what's not great is that we have a horrible leader,Wrong we are making poor choices. Not reaching out to our support system to make things right for the peopleZach A.,Denver,Male,18-34,Blue,$75K or more,Cauc,Weekly news viewer,Did not vote,"Partisan--everyone has their opinion and it seems like they are unwilling to compromise on anything.æ Changing-- my view is that the past election may push people towards changing their opinions. Unheard-- it is my opinion that the recent election showed that a lot of people felt they were not being considered. Misunderstood--these people are not crazy. They simply want their voice to be heard Divided--people seem to be very one way or another. It seems like they are struggling to find common ground",Even though there are disagreements I believe that this is one of the few places where different opinions we still have an open forum to debate out issues. I think it is not great that people seem so hostile to differing opinions. That will lead to people not being willing to offer an opinion different than the status quo. It will lead to stagnation in our country.,"I don't think their is a right or wrong direction. I believe that their may be a point we hit soon where the country will suffer because of a fear of offering a different opinion. That would be bad for the country. However, it may take us getting to that point to change."Zahoor K.,Chicago,Male,18-34,Blue,Less than $75K,Asian,Weekly news viewer,Did not vote,"Unstable Political environment, Declining Economic conditions, Lack of public trust, Growing inequality, Racial Divide.","whats not so great is the obvious feeling of instability-- I would say mainly because of the political environment. It is really easy to be worried about the future of our country in today's America.æBut despite all this, American land still holds the promise of a better future, I still believe one can move up the socioeconomic ladder given the right social and educational platform. I'm hopeful because I'm seeing more and more youth being politically active and working towards understanding the problems we are facing today.","I think as of this moment, July 2017, we are moving in the wrong direction. Why? Because of the political environment, our news cycles are filled with a new political scandal every day, you have prominent white house figures resigning, you've all sorts of conflicting ideas being presented by high ranking government bodies."Zuzu B.,,,,,,,,,,,
